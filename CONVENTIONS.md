## Design pattern

We are trying to maintain RESTful conventions as much as possible. Every actions are broken down to the 6 REST verbs. Those are:

> GET
> POST
> PUT
> PATCH
> DELETE
> OPTIONS

Create controller for an actions and perform any of these 6 actions.

## Folder Structure

We will try to follow folder structure for **_Controller_** with this broad three categories.

> Freelancer
> Recruiter
> Admin

This is the folder structure for **_views_**

> admin
> - This folder holds all admin related views.

> authentication
> - This folder holds all the authentication related views.

> components
> - This folder holds laravel components that are used in other views.
